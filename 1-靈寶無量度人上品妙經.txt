In the past, at the beggining, in the middle of the blue sky, the vast expanse of the blue realm, an empty song resounds grandly over the dark earth, receiving the initiation from the Primordial essence to guide countless beings of the highest capacities. Expected is to recite this scripture, circumambulating ten times - hence inviting the ten directions, beggining to lead to the throne. True and great heavenly being, the most revered sage, realized person of marvelous pratice, who, without harshness, repromands the masses, reaches the vermillion heaven riding the sky and a beautiful jade green carriage; Feathers forming a canopy, providing shade; a vital essence, vivid with five colours flows, Shining brightly in the vast emptiness. For seven days and nights all celestial bodies stop in their motion, the heaveanly wind goes quiet, mountains and seas cover the clouds, all thoughts becomes calm, one and the same, once again without high or low, The earth all becomes jade; without the existence of different apperances. Attending to the masses, the primoedial heavenly one  seated above, floating in emptiness, on top of a lion of five colors. Speaking of the scriptures all throughout, all heavenly sages at the same time praised virtue [within the scriptures] - leading to the opening of all of the ears of people of the land; twice [times reciting the scripture] and it is clear infront of their once blinded eyes; three times and though they were once mute, they can now speak words. Fourt times, and those who where lame can now walk; five times and the bodies of those who were once chronically ill, return back to normal; six timea and white hairs return black again and lost teeth grow back again; seven times and old become strong again and the young grow strong. eight times and the woman and bird become pregnant - all those previously born and those not yet born all attain rebirth; nine times and the ground flourishes with golden jade dew; ten times and shirevelled bones anew and evryone matures. At that point, everyone devotes their hearts, is proteced in their ractice and obtains long life   

道言：是時，元始天尊，說經一徧，東方無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經二徧，南方無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經三徧，西方無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經四徧，北方無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經五徧，東北無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經六徧，東南無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經七徧，西南無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經八徧，西北無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經九徧，上方無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。說經十徧，下方無極無量品至真大神，無鞅之眾，浮空而至。十徧周竟，十方無極天真大神，一時同至。一國男女，傾心歸仰。來者有如細雨密霧，無鞅之眾，迮國一半，土皆偏陷，非可禁止。於是元始懸一寶珠，大如黍米，在空玄之中，去地五丈。元始登引，天真大神，上聖高尊，妙行真人，十方無極至真大神，無鞅數眾，俱入寶珠之中。天人仰看，唯見勃勃從珠口中入。既入珠口，不知所在。國人廓散，地還平正，無復欹陷。元始即於寶珠之內，說經都竟，眾真監度，以授於我，當此之時，喜慶難言。法事粗悉，諸天復位，倏欻之間，寂無遺響。是時，天人遇值經法，普得濟度，全其本年，無有中傷，傾土歸仰，咸行善心。不殺不害，不嫉不妬，不淫不盜，不貪不欲，不憎不嫉，言無華綺，口無惡聲，齊同慈愛，異骨成親，國安民豐，欣樂太平，經始出教，一國以道，預有志心，宗奉禮敬，皆得度世。

"The Dao declares: At that time, Yuan Shi Tian Zun expounded the scriptures ten times. From the boundless East, South, West, North, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest, Upper, and Lower directions, countless truly great deities, a multitude without reins, floated and arrived. Completing the circuit of ten times, the boundless heavenly true great deities all arrived simultaneously. The men and women of the nation, moved by reverence, turned their hearts toward the divine.

The arrivals were like a fine rain and dense mist, an unrestrained multitude covering half the country, causing the land to tilt and sink, beyond control. In response, Yuan Shi suspended a precious pearl, large as millet, in the profound emptiness, five zhang above the ground. Ascending, Yuan Shi drew in the heavenly true great deities, the supremely sacred and revered, and the marvelous practicing true humans. Deities from the ten directions, a multitude without reins, all entered the precious pearl.

Heavenly and human beings gazed upward, witnessing the flourishing entry from the pearl's mouth. After entering, the deities' whereabouts became unknown. The people dispersed, the land leveled, and the tilting ceased. Yuan Shi, within the precious pearl, completed the scripture expounding. The multitude of true deities supervised, instructing and imparting teachings. At this moment, joy and celebration were beyond expression. The affairs of the law were understood, heavenly beings returned to their positions, and silence prevailed instantly.

At this time, heavenly and human beings, encountering the principles of scriptures, universally attained salvation, completing their lifespans without harm. The land turned toward reverence, and all practiced benevolent hearts. No killing, no harm, no jealousy, no envy, no licentiousness, no theft, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no envy. Words lacked embellishment, mouths lacked malicious sounds. All were in harmony with kindness and love. Diverse beings became kin, the country was secure, the people were prosperous, joyous, and peaceful. As the scriptures began to be taught, the nation followed the Dao, anticipating with sincere hearts, upholding with reverence, and all attained salvation in this world."
