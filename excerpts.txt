The principle of things reaches every corner of the physical world. When knowledge reaches its utmost, there is nothing my heart does not know exhaustively.

Organizing one's family and below is the business of cultivating a new generation. When the principle of things is understood to the utmost, one knows where to stop. When intent is sincere and follows below, all attains the sequence of where to stop."
