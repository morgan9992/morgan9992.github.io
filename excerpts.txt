"大學之道，在明明德，在親民，在止於至善" - "the way of great learning is to actualise illustrious virtue, to love the people and to rest in the highest excellence" 

"明德者，人之所得乎天，而虛靈不昧，以具眾理而應萬事者也"* - "As for one with clear virtue, it is what they obtain from heaven, and the numinous emptiness is not obscured; it is because one possesses The principle of the myriad phenomena which is non different to all things."

The term 虛靈 (xūlíng) was used by Zhu Xi to describe attributes of the mind that is, empty (虛) and spirit (靈). Begining with the former, we can understand 'empty' with the analogy of a mirror (many neo-confucian scholars use this explanation) ; a mirror that is reflecting no object is empty and it is also this inherent emptiness that allows to reflect objects in the first place, likwise is the human mind empty in its original state therefore it can encounter and accept external objects. 'Spirit' is considered a seperate property of the mind ; with the same analogy: although it is inherently empty, the essence of a mirror can be said to depend on its function of reflecting objects and this essence is the actual action of the mind interacting with external objects.  虛靈 is considered to be an attribute that only the human mind posseses (ie. animals don't have it) since animals don't have the ability to discern right from wrong or investiagte the fundamental principles behind things. It was also taught that 靈 arised from the combination of li and qi or for those who held that the mind was constituted of purely qi only, they insisted that the 'spirit' aspect of the mind arised from the uniqueness of the heart itself, which is the clearest and most precise part of the qi.

"但為氣稟所拘，人欲所蔽，則有時而昏；然其本體之明，則有未嘗息者"* - "yet bound by an endowed disposition, and obstructed by desires, there are times when [the mind] is confused. However, its original state is clear though there has never been a moment of stillness."

following from the above concept of 虛靈, emptiness is obscured and tinged by desire. 


"故學者當因其所發而遂明之，以復其初也。新者，革其舊之謂也，言既自明其明德，又當推以及人，使之亦有以去其舊染之污也"* - "Therefore, learners should understand it according to what arises from it, thereby restoring its original state. The new is what is called the replacement of the old. their speech should already self-illuminate their bright virtue, and also should serve to reach out to help others, Making it also have a way to remove the defilements of its old stains".       


"知止而后有定，定而后能靜，靜而后能安，安而后能慮，慮而后能得" - "Know the end and then you can have stability; be stable and then you can be tranquil; be tranquil and then you can be at peace; be at peace and then you can carefully think; think carefully, and then you can attain"


"止者，所當止之地，即至善之所在也"* - "That which stops is the place where one should stop, namely the location of ultimate goodness."

"古之欲明明德於天下者，先治其國；欲治其國者，先齊其家；欲齊其家者，先脩其身；欲脩其身者，先正其心；欲正其心者，先誠其意；欲誠其意者，先致其知；致知在格物" - "In ancient times, those desiring to manifest their virtue in the world first governed their own countries; those desiring to govern their countries first put their own families in order; those desiring to regulate their families first cultivated themselves; those desiring to cultivate themselves first corrected their minds; those desiring to correct their minds first embraced sincerity in their intentions; those desiring sincerity in their intentions first attained knowledge; attaining knowledge is in investigating things"

"實其心之所發，欲其一於善而無自欺也"* - "Actualize that which is emitted by the heart, desiring to be united with goodness and without self-deception."


"致，推極也。知，猶識也。推極吾之知識，欲其所知無不盡也。格，至也。物，猶事也。窮至事物之理，欲其極處無不到也。此八者，大學之條目也。"* - "Achieve, pushing to the extreme. Knowledge, similar to recognition. Pushing my knowledge to the extreme, desiring that there be nothing not thoroughly known. Arrive, to. Things, similar to affairs. Exhausting the principles of things, desiring to reach every extreme. These eight are the items of the Great Learning."


"治，去聲，後放此。物格者，物理之極處無不到也。知至者，吾心之所知無不盡也。知既盡，則意可得而實矣，意既實，則心可得而正矣。脩身以上，明明德之事也。齊家以下，新民之事也。物格知至，則知所止矣。意誠以下，則皆得所止之序也"* - "To govern, it is set aside after the departing tone. The principle of things reaches every corner of the physical world. When knowledge reaches its utmost, there is nothing my heart does not know exhaustively. When knowledge is exhausted, intent can be made real, and when intent is made real, the heart can be made upright. Cultivating oneself and beyond is the business of illuminating moral virtues. Organizing one's family and below is the business of cultivating a new generation. When the principle of things is understood to the utmost, one knows where to stop. When intent is sincere and follows below, all attains the sequence of where to stop."
