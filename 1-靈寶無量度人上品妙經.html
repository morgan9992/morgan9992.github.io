In the past, at the beggining, in the middle of the blue sky, the vast expanse of the blue realm, an empty song resounds grandly over the dark earth, receiving the initiation from the Primordial essence to guide countless beings of the highest capacities. Expected is to recite this scripture, circumambulating ten times - hence inviting the ten directions, beggining to lead to the throne. True and great heavenly being, the most revered sage, realized person of marvelous pratice, who, without harshness, repromands the masses, reaches the vermillion heaven riding the sky and a beautiful jade green carriage; Feathers forming a canopy, providing shade; a vital essence, vivid with five colours flows, Shining brightly in the vast emptiness. For seven days and nights all celestial bodies stop in their motion, the heaveanly wind goes quiet, mountains and seas cover the clouds, all thoughts becomes calm, one and the same, once again without high or low, The earth all becomes jade; without the existence of different apperances. Attending to the masses, the primoedial heavenly one  seated above, floating in emptiness, on top of a lion of five colors. Speaking of the scriptures all throughout, all heavenly sages at the same time praised virtue [within the scriptures] - leading to the opening of all of the ears of people of the land; twice [times reciting the scripture] and it is clear infront of their once blinded eyes; three times and though they were once mute, they can now speak words. Fourt times, and those who where lame can now walk; five times and the bodies of those who were once chronically ill, return back to normal; six timea and white hairs return black again and lost teeth grow back again; seven times and old become strong again and the young grow strong. eight times and the woman and bird become pregnant - all those previously born and those not yet born all attain rebirth; nine times and the ground flourishes with golden jade dew; ten times and shirevelled bones anew and evryone matures. At that point, everyone devotes their hearts, is proteced in their ractice and obtains long life
