Introduction
-------------------
Indeed, the gamut of the teachings bears no name/characteristics and the its profound meanings are difficult to convey in words. For this reason, Shakyamuni came into this world to teach the dharma, consisting of the three aspects: regulating acts of speech and body and guarding against unwholsome actions (vinaya), comprehension of good and evil through sutras (suttra) and exposition on the subtle and profound aspects of the dharama (abidharma). The Tripitaka was thus created of these three. At the root, all teachings are non different since all paths have the same destination. 

[classifications of the tripitaka:] prohibitions and precepts: The ten recitations Vinaya (Sarvāstivāda version of vinaya), the four part vinaya (Dharmaguptaka version); Characteristics of the dharma: the Abhidharma, Śāriputrābhidharma (possibly, though could refer to Sarvāstivādin version instead); scriptures - The four agama collection: Ekottara Agama - four parts, eight recitations, Madhyama Agama - four parts, five recitations, Samyukta Agama - four parts, ten recitations, Dirgha Agama - four parts, four recitations. Thirty scriptures considered as one collection. 
      
Returning to the dharma by the Agama In the Chinese (Qin) language.  It [the Agama] is the treasury of myriad virtues; it upholds the grove-garden; it is vast and extensive, profound and great, Hidden and yet broad, clearly proclaiming the traces of misfortune and fortune via historical accounts of success and failure. It upholds the Yin and Yang, the origin of all things, The way / Dao that does nothing and is everywhere - it can be compared to the vast sea, the convergence of all rivers. For this reason, the dharma returns to its name. [The Agama] analyses pratice of the way; it is a very long document, long is in its name but utilise it and one will suddenly be able to differentiate the right from the wrong and understand cause and effect. Although transmigration  occurs for countless kalpas, it will appear [as short as] day and night; although the six directions are vast and extensive, it will seem as if all if just in front of your eyes.  It can be described as being illuminated in a dark place; opening the fives eyes, wisdom at this point is without obstructions and limits.       

Great heavenly emperour of Qin ( most likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Xing), purify and eliminate with profound comtemplation, soar with a unique charm; silent wisdom joined with cultivation; the way aids both oneself and the world; always fearing that subtle words are obscured in different cultures. Through The right commander agent it governs and controls thus it can be compared to the duke of Jin. Having the qualities of being straightforward, pure, and gentle, the unfathomable mind that transcends and reaches, repestcs and upholds the great dharma; the wonderful realisation of the original nature, holding to the superior true mind; surrendering to the cause of the dharma. During the 12 years virtuous reign of Hong Shi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Xing), Buddhayaśas produced / compiled (maybe translated although he is said to have translated a different school's vinaya - https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E5%88%86%E5%BE%8B) the vinaya, up to the fourteenth year. In the fithteenth year of Zhāoyáng (https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%98%AD%E9%98%B3_(%E6%A5%9A%E5%9B%BD |  https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%AA%E6%AD%B2%E7%B4%80%E5%B9%B4 ), concluding with the translation of this long agama sutra. In Liángzhōu,  Buddhānanda (https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E7%AB%BA%E4%BD%9B%E5%BF%B5#) was the translator; in the state of qin other monks were translators / writers. At that time, monks were gathered in the capital where it (the translation) was checked / proof read. Humbly receive the dharma without discrimination, eliminate extravagence and honour simplicity, diligently preseve holy intention. I meet good occaisons with insignificant pratices; although without wings of virtue, [I] anticipate future buddhahood to actualise becoming a sage.
