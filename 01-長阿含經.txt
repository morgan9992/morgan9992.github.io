Introduction
-------------------
Indeed, the gamut of the teachings bears no name/characteristics and the its profound meanings are difficult to convey in words. For this reason, Shakyamuni came into this world to teach the dharma, consisting of the three aspects: regulating acts of speech and body and guarding against unwholsome actions (vinaya), comprehension of good and evil through sutras (suttra) and exposition on the subtle and profound aspects of the dharama (abidharma). The Tripitaka was thus created of these three. At the root, all teachings are non different since all paths have the same destination. 

[classifications of the tripitaka:] prohibitions and precepts: The ten recitations Vinaya (Sarvāstivāda version of vinaya), the four part vinaya (Dharmaguptaka version); Characteristics of the dharma: the Abhidharma, Śāriputrābhidharma (possibly, though could refer to Sarvāstivādin version instead); scriptures - The four agama collection: Ekottara Agama - four parts, eight recitations, Madhyama Agama - four parts, five recitations, Samyukta Agama - four parts, ten recitations, Dirgha Agama - four parts, four recitations. Thirty scriptures considered as one collection. 
      
Returning to the dharma by the Agama In the Chinese (Qin) language.  It [the Agama] is the treasury of myriad virtues; it upholds the grove-garden; it is vast and extensive, profound and great, Hidden and yet broad, clearly proclaiming the traces of misfortune and fortune via historical accounts of success and failure. It upholds the Yin and Yang, the origin of all things, The way / Dao that does nothing and is everywhere - it can be compared to the vast sea, the convergence of all rivers. For this reason, the dharma returns to its name. [The Agama] analyses pratice of the way; it is a very long document, long is in its name but utilise it and one will suddenly be able to differentiate the right from the wrong and understand cause and effect. Although transmigration  occurs for countless kalpas, it will appear [as short as] day and night; although the six directions are vast and extensive, it will seem as if all if just in front of your eyes.  It can be described as being illuminated in a dark place; opening the fives eyes, wisdom at this point is without obstructions and limits.       

Great heavenly emperour of Qin ( most likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Xing), purify and eliminate with profound comtemplation, soar with a unique charm; silent wisdom joined with cultivation; the way aids both oneself and the world; always fearing that subtle words are obscured in different cultures. Through The right commander agent it governs and controls thus it can be compared to the duke of Jin. Having the qualities of being straightforward, pure, and gentle, the unfathomable mind that transcends and reaches, repestcs and upholds the great dharma; the wonderful realisation of the original nature, holding to the superior true mind; surrendering to the cause of the dharma. During the 12 years virtuous reign of Hong Shi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Xing), Buddhayaśas produced / compiled (maybe translated although he is said to have translated a different school's vinaya - https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E5%88%86%E5%BE%8B) the vinaya, up to the fourteenth year. In the fithteenth year of Zhāoyáng (https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%98%AD%E9%98%B3_(%E6%A5%9A%E5%9B%BD |  https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%AA%E6%AD%B2%E7%B4%80%E5%B9%B4 ), concluding with the translation of this long agama sutra. In Liángzhōu,  Buddhānanda (https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E7%AB%BA%E4%BD%9B%E5%BF%B5#) was the translator; in the state of qin other monks were translators / writers. At that time, monks were gathered in the capital where it (the translation) was checked / proof read. Humbly receive the dharma without discrimination, eliminate extravagence and honour simplicity, diligently preseve holy intention. I meet good occaisons with insignificant pratices; although without wings of virtue, [I] anticipate future buddhahood to actualise becoming a sage.

如是我聞：

一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹花林窟，與大比丘眾千二百五十人俱。
"Thus, I heard At one time, the Buddha was in a cave in the flower grove of Śrāvastī, together with a great assembly of one thousand two hundred fifty bhikkhus."

時，諸比丘於乞食後集花林堂，各共議言：「諸賢比丘！唯無上尊為最奇特，神通遠達，威力弘大，乃知過去無數諸佛，入於涅槃，斷諸結使，消滅戱論。又知彼佛劫數多少，名號、姓字，所生種族，其所飲食，壽命脩短，所更苦樂。又知彼佛有如是戒，有如是法，有如是慧，有如是解，有如是住。云何，諸賢！如來為善別法性，知如是事，為諸天來語，乃知此事？」
"At that moment, all the bhikkhus gathered at Flower Grove Hall after the alms-round. They jointly discussed and said to one another, 'All venerable bhikkhus, only the Supreme Honored One is the most remarkable and extraordinary. His supernatural powers are far-reaching, and his mighty power is vast and great. Then they know

爾時，世尊在閑靜處，天耳清淨，聞諸比丘作如是議，即從座起，詣花林堂，就座而坐。 
"At that time, the World-Honored One, situated in a quiet place with pure and clear divine ears, heard the monks discussing a certain matter. Immediately, he rose from his seat and went to the Flower Grove Pavilion, where he sat down."

爾時，世尊知而故問，謂：「諸比丘！汝等集此，何所語議？」時，諸比丘具以事答。
"At that time, the World-Honored One, being aware and intentionally asking, said: 'Monks, having gathered here, what are you discussing?' At that moment, all the monks replied with the details."

爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「善哉！善哉！汝等以平等信，出家修道，諸所應行，凡有二業：一曰賢聖講法，二曰賢聖默然。汝等所論，正應如是。如來神通，威力弘大，盡知過去無數劫事，以能善解法性故知，亦以諸天來語故知。」佛時頌曰：
"At that time, the World-Honored One addressed all the monks, praising them for their equal faith in leaving household life to cultivate the Way. He emphasized two essential practices: the wise and holy ones should either expound the Dharma or remain silent. The discussion among the monks should align with these principles. The Buddha, possessing vast supernatural powers, fully knows countless events of the past over eons, skillfully understanding the nature of Dharma. Additionally, he knows through the speech of various heavenly beings who come and speak. The passage concludes with a verse spoken by the Buddha."

「比丘集法堂，　　講說賢聖論；
如來處靜室，　　天耳盡聞知。
佛日光普照，　　分別法界義；
亦知過去事，　　三佛般泥洹。
名號、姓、種族，　　受生分亦知；
隨彼之處所，　　淨眼皆記之。
諸天大威力，　　容貌甚端嚴；
亦來啟告我，　　三佛般泥洹。
記生、名號、姓，　　哀鸞音盡知；
無上天人尊，　　記於過去佛。」

"Monks assemble in the Dharma hall, expounding on the discourse of the virtuous and the sage. The Tathagata resides in a tranquil chamber; his divine ears fully hear and understand. The Buddha's radiant light universally illuminates, distinguishing the meanings within the realm of Dharma. He also knows the past events, attaining the enlightenment shared by the three Buddhas. Names, surnames, and ethnicities, as well as the allocation of births, he comprehends. In whatever place, his pure eyes remember all. The great powerful beings in heaven, with exceedingly stern countenances. They also come to inform and enlighten me, sharing in the enlightenment of the three Buddhas. Remembering births, names, and surnames, understanding completely like the mournful sound of a dove. The supreme celestial beings, revered and honored, record the deeds of past Buddhas."

又告諸比丘：「汝等欲聞如來識宿命智，知於過去諸佛因緣不？我當說之。」 
"Do you wish to hear about the Tathagata's wisdom regarding knowledge of past lives and whether you know the causes and conditions of all past Buddhas? I shall speak about it."
