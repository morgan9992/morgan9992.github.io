Axioms
------
. When one thing is predicated of another, whatever is said of the predicated is also said of the predicating

. Differentiae of different genera that aren't subordinate to each other must necessarily themselves be different 

. It is possible for Differentiae to be shared in genera that are subordinate to one another

. The ten things (below), when affirmed by themselves aren't deemed true or false but Instead, it is the combination of them that can be considered so.

. When one thing is of another, it is predicated of the subject and therefore the name and definition are inherited from that thing

. Everything called from substances and differentia are called so synonymously  
substance 

Four-Fold Classification
------------------------
Said In A Subject (SI) - contained within something else | T: 'Accidental' ; F: 'Non Accidental'  

Said Of A Subject (SO) - within the Scope of something else | T: 'Universal' ; F: 'Particular' 

	--> thus follows four-fold classification 
		
		- Primary Substances (Non Accidental Particular)
		  eg. Individual Man 
		- Essential Universals (Non Accidental Universal)
		  eg. Man in General
		- Definite Qualities (Accidental Particular)
		  eg. Specific Redness of a Flower 
		- General qualities (Accidental Universal) 
		  eg. General Redness of a Flower
