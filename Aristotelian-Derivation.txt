Definitions 
-----------
Differentiae - qualities of species that differentiate them inside a genus  
Genus - a class that species can be grouped into based on shared characteristics 
Homonyms - things with the same name (can be what they receive via predicate) and different definitions
Paronyms - things whose names derive from different roots 
Synonyms - things with the same name and have the same definition of being 

Axioms
------
. When one thing is predicated of another, whatever is said of the predicated is also said of the predicating

. Differentiae of different genera that aren't subordinate to each other must necessarily themselves be different 

. It is possible for Differentiae to be shared in genera that are subordinate to one another

. The ten things (below), when affirmed by themselves aren't deemed true or false but Instead, it is the combination of them that can be considered so.

. When one thing is of another, it is predicated of the subject and therefore the name and definition are inherited from that thing

. Differentia are predicated of that which has said differentia 

. Everything called from substances and differentia are called so synonymously  
substance 

Four-Fold Classification
------------------------
Said In A Subject (SI) - contained within something else | T: 'Accidental' ; F: 'Non Accidental'  

Said Of A Subject (SO) - within the Scope of something else | T: 'Universal' ; F: 'Particular' 

	--> thus follows four-fold classification 
		
		- Primary Substances (Non Accidental Particular)
		  eg. Individual Man 
		- Essential Universals (Non Accidental Universal)
		  eg. Man in General
		- Definite Qualities (Accidental Particular)
		  eg. Specific Redness of a Flower 
		- General qualities (Accidental Universal) 
		  eg. General Redness of a Flower

                        - Substance
				- Immobile Substances — Unmoved Mover(s) 
				- Mobile Substances — Body
					- Eternal Mobile Substances — Heavens
					- Destructible Mobile Substances — Sublunary bodies
						- Unensouled Destructible Mobile Substances — Elements
						- Ensouled Destructible Mobile Substances — Living things
							- Incapable of Perception — Plants
							- Capable of Perception — Animals
								- Irrational — Non-Human Animals
								- Rational — Humans
			Axioms: 
			. Have no contratries 
			. No more or less comparision 
			. Everything that isn't a primary substance is either said of it or present in it
			. a substance, numerically one and the same can receive contrays (eg. at different times)

			- Quantity
				- Continuous Quantities
					- line
					- surface
					- body
					- time
					- place
				- Discrete Quantities
					- number
					- speech
			Axioms:
			. Definite quantities have no contrary 
			. Composed of parts which have position in relation to one another:
			line - T
			Surface - T 	
			Body - T
			place - T 
			Number - F
			Time - F
			Speech - F

			. Every other Thing (10 Things) doesen't posses a quantity aspect
			. of the quantities, only place can admit of contraries
			. No more or less comparision 
			. can be equal or unequal to each other 

			- Quality
				- States and Conditions 
				- Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities
				- Affective Qualities and Affections
				- Shape
			Axioms:
			. States are distinguished from conditions based upon their length of time being asociated with the subject
			. All states are necessarily also conditions but not all conditions are states 
			. Things said to be qualified are named paronymously with respect to the corresponding quality ; notable exceptions:
			Many Natural Capabilities (eg. Boxer,runner)
			cases in which the quality differs from the affection we say something has to be qualified (eg. virtue for someone to be good)

			. Can have contraries ; notable exceptions:
			Some Shapes (eg. square, triangle etc.)
			Some Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities (eg. Boxer, Runner etc.) 

			. Can have more or less comparisions ; notable exceptions  
			Some Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities (eg. Boxer, Runner etc.) 
			Shapes

			. It is through qualities that things are rendered similar or dissimilar 

			- Relatives
				- State
				- Condition
				- Perception
				- Knowledge
				- Position
			Axioms:
			. When given correctly, relatives reciprocate 
			. Can have contraries ; notable exceptions:
			Quantitative (eg. Double, Triple etc.)

			. Don't exist without the thing to which they are relative ; notable exceptions:
			Knowable & knowledge 
			Perceptable & Perceive 

			. Knowledge of a relative comparision must necessarily mean knowledge of both things which are relatives 

			
			- Somewhere 

			- Sometime

			- Being in a Position

			- Having

			- Actng 

			- Being Acted Upon
- Opposites 
	- Relatives
	- Contraries
	- Privation and Possession
	- Affirmation and Negation
Axioms:
. Opposed relatives are called just what they are (eg. Double and it's contrary are both exactly the same as each other except for being opposites (X2 and /2)
. Contraries are called opposingly (ie. the alternate way to first axiom eg. black and White)
. If one of two opposites must exist in a subject, then no intermediate can occur (eg. body can either be considered healthy or sick)
. provation and possession re said in relation to whatever possession (or not) of said thing naturally occurs in 
. Distinction between privation and to be deprived (eg. blindness is a privation whereas being blind is deprived of sight)
. What underlies an affirmation or negation is not itself an affirmation or negation 
. If One thing exists, it is not required that its contrary exists 
. All contraries must either be in the same genus or in contrary genera, or be themselves genera
. Contraries must belong to the same thing - either in same genus or species (eg. Sickness and health exist in an animals body) 

- Prior
	- Time
	- Implication of Existence (eg. if there is two there must at one time had been one ; doesen't hold other way around)
	- Sequence (eg. In a speech, the introduction comes prior to the conclusion)
	- Prior by nature (in terms of status or virtue)
	- True statements (a things existence proceeds the validity of the stamenet about it's existence)
	- Genera as prior to species 
- Simultaneity
	- Come into existence at same time 
	- reciprocality ( eg. Double dosen't precede half thus they are simultaneous) 
	- Coordinate species of the same genus (eg. the genus animal is divided into bird, beast and animal which are the direct subclassifications of animal 	and thus none of the 3 are prior to the other 2.)

- Change 
	- Generation
	- Destruction
	- Increase
	- Diminution
	- Alteration
	- Change of place
Axioms:
. Have contraries
