Quanzhen (全真)
--------------
Quanzhen is the main official branch of Daoism in mainland China, perhaps earning status via continual official protection from the state since 1197. The school sprung up in 1170 and was the first Daoist monastic order in which members could be more easily registered and who were distinguished easily from the lay by their garments. They followed buddhist standards of monasticism, including celibacy. Quanzhen was founded by Wang Zhe (王重陽) a neidan practitioner who lived as a hermit in the Zhongnan
mountains (situated in the landlocked Shaanxi Province), and was supposedly guided in his practice of neidan by popular immortals of the Daoist tradition. in 1167, Wang Zhe moved to Shdong province (eastern coast) where he converted several people to his teachings ; seven of these converts were later considered the 'Seven Real Men' (qizhen 七真). Wang evenetually travelled with his four favourite disciples back to the west but died on the journey ; his disciples carried his coffin to the Zhongnan
mountains and then began to spread the quanzhen teachings.
