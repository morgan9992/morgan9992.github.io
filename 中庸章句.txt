中庸何為而作也？子思子憂道學之失其傳而作也。蓋自上古聖神繼天立極，而道統之傳有自來矣。其見於經，則「允執厥中」者，堯之所以授舜也；「人心惟危，道心惟微，惟精惟一，允執厥中」者，舜之所以授禹也。堯之一言，至矣，盡矣！而舜復益之以三言者，則所以明夫堯之一言，必如是而後可庶幾也
"What is the doctrine of the mean and why was it written ? The Doctrine of the Mean was written because Zisi and Ziyu were concerned about the deviation in the transmission of the way and learning. Since ancient times, sages have continued the Heavenly mandate, ensuring the continuous transmission of the way. In the classics, Yao's* method of instructing Shun* was to adhere sincerely to the mean, emphasizing balance. Shun, in turn, applied the principle in instructing Yu*, emphasizing the importance of purity and unity. Yao's single word was ultimate and exhaustive, and Shun's addition of three words clarified Yao's teaching, making it more understandable."

蓋嘗論之：心之虛靈知覺，一而已矣，而以為有人心、道心之異者，則以其或生於形氣之私，或原於性命之正，而所以為知覺者不同，是以或危殆而不安，或微妙而難見耳。然人莫不有是形，故雖上智不能無人心，亦莫不有是性，故雖下愚不能無道心。二者雜於方寸之間，而不知所以治之，則危者愈危，微者愈微，而天理之公卒無以勝夫人欲之私矣。精則察夫二者之間而不雜也，一則守其本心之正而不離也。從事於斯，無少閒斷，必使道心常為一身之主，而人心每聽命焉，則危者安、微者著，而動靜云為自無過不及之差矣。
"Indeed, I have discussed this before: the mind's numinous emptiness awareness is singular and complete. And those who consider there to be a difference between the human mind and the mind of the way, it is because some believe it originates from personal aspects of the formed and formless, or that it originates from the correctness of one's nature and life, and the reason for the difference in being aware is that some are in danger and precarious, not at peace, or subtle and delicate, hard to perceive indeed. However, everyone possesses such a form; therefore, although the highest wisdom cannot be without the human mind, likewise, everyone possesses such a nature; therefore, although the lowest foolishness cannot be without the mind of the way. Both are mixed within the square inch of the heart-mind, yet do not know the reason for managing it; then those in danger become even more endangered, and those delicate become even more delicate, and in the end, universal natural principles cannot overcome human desires and selfishness. With essence, examine the space between these two without mixing; one should guard the correctness of the original heart-mind without departing. Engaging in this, without making idle judgments, one must make the Dao-heart always be the master of one's own body, and the human mind should always listen and obey it; then those in danger will be safe, and those delicate will stabilize, and the distinction between movement and stillness can be described as self without excess or deficiency."

夫堯、舜、禹，天下之大聖也。以天下相傳，天下之大事也。以天下之大聖，行天下之大事，而其授受之際，丁寧告戒，不過如此。則天下之理，豈有以加於此哉？自是以來，聖聖相承：若成湯、文、武之為君，皋陶、伊、傅、周、召之為臣，既皆以此而接夫道統之傳，若吾夫子，則雖不得其位，而所以繼往聖、開來學，其功反有賢於堯舜者。然當是時，見而知之者，惟顏氏、曾氏之傳得其宗。及曾氏之再傳，而復得夫子之孫子思，則去聖遠而異端起矣。子思懼夫愈久而愈失其真也，於是推本堯舜以來相傳之意，質以平日所聞父師之言，更互演繹，作為此書，以詔後之學者。蓋其憂之也深，故其言之也切；其慮之也遠，故其說之也詳。其曰「天命率性」，則道心之謂也；其曰「擇善固執」，則精一之謂也；其曰「君子時中」，則執中之謂也。世之相後，千有餘年，而其言之不異，如合符節。歷選前聖之書，所以提挈綱維、開示蘊奧，未有若是之明且盡者也。自是而又再傳以得孟氏，為能推明是書，以承先聖之統，及其沒而遂失其傳焉。則吾道之所寄不越乎言語文字之閒，而異端之說日新月盛，以至於老佛之徒出，則彌近理而大亂真矣。然而尚幸此書之不泯，故程夫子兄弟者出，得有所考，以續夫千載不傳之緒；得有所據，以斥夫二家似是之非。蓋子思之功於是為大，而微程夫子，則亦莫能因其語而得其心也。惜乎！其所以為說者不傳，而凡石氏之所輯錄，僅出於其門人之所記，是以大義雖明，而微言未析。至其門人所自為說，則雖頗詳盡而多所發明，然倍其師說而淫於老佛者，亦有之矣。

"Now, Yao, Shun, and Yu were the great sages of the world, and their legacy, passed down throughout the world, involved the great affairs of the world. The great sages of the world, while performing these great affairs, meticulously gave instructions and warnings at the moment of bestowing and receiving, not going beyond this. Therefore, could there be anything to add to the principles of the world? Since then, sages have been passing down to sages. If there are kings like Cheng Tang, Wen, and Wu, and ministers like Gao Yao, Yi, Fu, Zhou, and Shao, all connecting through this to transmit the Way, if our master, even though not obtaining their positions, has the means to continue the ways of the past sages and open up new teachings, his achievements, in turn, surpass those who are more virtuous than Yao and Shun. However, at that time, those who see and understand are only the transmissions of the Yan* and Zeng families truly understanding it. After the Zeng family's further transmission, the thoughts of Master Zi Si, Confucius's grandson, were incorporated, leading to the emergence of a distinct school departing from the path of the sage. Zi Si, fearing the gradual loss of the essence, diligently traced the original intentions from the time of Yao and Shun. He verified these teachings with the words heard from his teachers in everyday life, elaborated on them in mutual interpretation, and composed this book to instruct future scholars. Zi Si's profound concerns and far-reaching considerations are reflected in his sharp and detailed expressions. Examples from his teachings, such as 'Heaven's mandate leads one's nature,' 'Choose the good and hold fast to it,' and 'The noble person is timely and centered,' illustrate concepts like the Way of the Heart, Unity of Essence, and holding to the center. Over more than a thousand years, the teachings have remained unchanged, resembling a well-ordered composition. Through selecting the books of the ancient sages, it is intended to lift and uphold principles and essentials, disclose profound meanings, and never has there been such clarity and completeness. From this point onwards, the transmission was again conducted to obtain the teachings of Mencius, in order to elucidate and clarify these books, inheriting the tradition of the ancient sages. However, with the passing of Mencius, the transmission was lost. Then, my way of interpreting is entrusted not to go beyond the realm of language and writing, and divergent views are increasingly proliferating day by day, leading to the emergence of followers of distorted beliefs, thus increasingly approaching principles and greatly disturbing the truth. However, it is fortunate that this book has not been lost or forgotten; therefore, the Cheng brothers emerged, gaining the opportunity to study and continue the teachings that had not been transmitted for a thousand years. They obtained a basis to rely upon, enabling them to reject the seemingly correct but actually false views of the two schools. Indeed, the contribution of Confucius in this regard is significant, while the contribution of the Cheng brothers is subtle, and one cannot fully grasp their understanding by merely relying on their words. Alas! The reasons for its teachings are not transmitted. Regarding the compilation by the Shi family, it is solely based on records kept by their disciples. Hence, while the general principles are clear, the subtle details remain unanalyzed. When the disciples explain on their own, although their interpretations may be detailed and many points clarified, there are also those who, having surpassed their masters' teachings, indulge excessively in Daoist and Buddhist ideas."
