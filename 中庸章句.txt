中庸何為而作也？子思子憂道學之失其傳而作也。蓋自上古聖神繼天立極，而道統之傳有自來矣。其見於經，則「允執厥中」者，堯之所以授舜也；「人心惟危，道心惟微，惟精惟一，允執厥中」者，舜之所以授禹也。堯之一言，至矣，盡矣！而舜復益之以三言者，則所以明夫堯之一言，必如是而後可庶幾也
"What is the doctrine of the mean and why was it written ? The Doctrine of the Mean was written because Zisi and Ziyu were concerned about the deviation in the transmission of the way and learning. Since ancient times, sages have continued the Heavenly mandate, ensuring the continuous transmission of the way. In the classics, Yao's* method of instructing Shun* was to adhere sincerely to the mean, emphasizing balance. Shun, in turn, applied the principle in instructing Yu*, emphasizing the importance of purity and unity. Yao's single word was ultimate and exhaustive, and Shun's addition of three words clarified Yao's teaching, making it more understandable."

*Emperor Shun - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun - states Yao's method in instructing Shun as Shun succeeded Yao as emperour
*Emperor Yu the great - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great - succeeded Shun 

蓋嘗論之：心之虛靈知覺，一而已矣，而以為有人心、道心之異者，則以其或生於形氣之私，或原於性命之正，而所以為知覺者不同，是以或危殆而不安，或微妙而難見耳。然人莫不有是形，故雖上智不能無人心，亦莫不有是性，故雖下愚不能無道心。二者雜於方寸之間，而不知所以治之，則危者愈危，微者愈微，而天理之公卒無以勝夫人欲之私矣。精則察夫二者之間而不雜也，一則守其本心之正而不離也。從事於斯，無少閒斷，必使道心常為一身之主，而人心每聽命焉，則危者安、微者著，而動靜云為自無過不及之差矣。
"Indeed, I have discussed this before: the mind's numinous emptiness awareness is singular and complete. And those who consider there to be a difference between the human mind and the mind of the way, it is because some believe it originates from personal aspects of the formed and formless, or that it originates from the correctness of one's nature and life, and the reason for the difference in being aware is that some are in danger and precarious, not at peace, or subtle and delicate, hard to perceive indeed. However, everyone possesses such a form; therefore, although the highest wisdom cannot be without the human mind, likewise, everyone possesses such a nature; therefore, although the lowest foolishness cannot be without the mind of the way. Both are mixed within the square inch of the heart-mind, yet do not know the reason for managing it; then those in danger become even more endangered, and those delicate become even more delicate, and in the end, universal natural principles cannot overcome human desires and selfishness. With essence, examine the space between these two without mixing; one should guard the correctness of the original heart-mind without departing. Engaging in this, without making idle judgments, one must make the Dao-heart always be the master of one's own body, and the human mind should always listen and obey it; then those in danger will be safe, and those delicate will stabilize, and the distinction between movement and stillness can be described as self without excess or deficiency."
