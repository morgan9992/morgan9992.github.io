中庸何為而作也？子思子憂道學之失其傳而作也。蓋自上古聖神繼天立極，而道統之傳有自來矣。其見於經，則「允執厥中」者，堯之所以授舜也；「人心惟危，道心惟微，惟精惟一，允執厥中」者，舜之所以授禹也。堯之一言，至矣，盡矣！而舜復益之以三言者，則所以明夫堯之一言，必如是而後可庶幾也
"The Doctrine of the Mean was written because Zisi and Ziyu were concerned about the deviation in the transmission of the Dao and learning. Since ancient times, sages have continued the Heavenly mandate, ensuring the continuous transmission of the Dao. In the classics, Yao's method of instructing Shun was to adhere sincerely to the mean, emphasizing balance. Shun, in turn, applied the principle in instructing Yu, emphasizing the importance of purity and unity. Yao's single word was ultimate and exhaustive, and Shun's addition of three words clarified Yao's teaching, making it more understandable."
