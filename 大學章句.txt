Synopsis
---------
It is a shame how little english literature there is presently on Confucianism, even more so Neo Confucianism; this great philsophical and spiritual tradition has been left relatively untouched by western scholarship and thus in this writting, the first of a series on Zhu xi's commentaries, I aim, even with my relatively limited knowledge on the topic (I am not at all a scholar), to shed some light on this neglected part of Chinese culture and Philsophy. Feel free to replicate the content in this text (and the site as whole) in whatever way you wish.    



Introduction
-------------
A short saying of Confucius -  
"學而時習之，不亦說乎？" [1] "to learn and in Time, apply it. Is that not a great pleasure ?"  

We don't have to go far, not far at all in fact, (the first line of the analects to be precise) to witness the significance Confucius places on learning  in the process of self cultivation and although this quote isn't from 大學 (the great learning, the focus of this part of Zhu Xi's collected commentaries on the four books - 四書章句集注) I felt it is very much necessary. For Confucius, learning is the start of becoming a 
君子 (Py. Junzi - meaning sage) and is what forms the basis for the rest of one's development; as we shall see next, Master Zhu explains the effect of learning from a metaphysical angle ( a key characteristic of Neo confucian thought) with concepts familiar in the philosophical/religious climate he was present in such as qi and Tian which helped to reinvigorate this learning  of Ru thought in China, and more widely east Asia.


Paragraph 1
---------------------
"古之大學所以教人之法也" - of old, the great learning of books has been the way of teaching people. 

The method of great learning has been employed in China since early times as a way of cultivation 

"蓋自天降生民 ，則既莫不與之以仁義禮智之性矣" - people descend from heaven and hence they are naturally endowed with the virtues of ren, li, justice and wisdom

These 4 virtues, known as 四端 also translated as four begginings or four seeds to reflect the proposed nature of them, that is that they are inherently inside every human is a premise emphasised particularly by Mengzi/mencius. As we can see, Zhu Xi takes this idea and expresses it in a metaphysical light - stating it was endowed by heaven.   

.however their chi is not necessarily the same, everyone doesn't posses the knowledge to fulfill their chi but with knowledge and wisdom they can actualisé it.

. heaven appoints such people with fulfilled qi and virtue to instruct / rule the masses, and will continue to choose the virtuous for this task 

. it is a matter of recovering and restoring qi 

Paragraph 2
---------------------

"三代之隆，其法寖備，然後王宮、國都以及閭巷，莫不有學" - "The three dynasties of flourishing  (Xia, Yin, Zhou) gradually perfected their ways in the districts they reigned over, no where was there not learning"

. I will certainly expand on this point when I write a commentary on the five classics but essentially, Confucius beleived that the study of historic dynasties (particularly the Zhou) and implementing their ways was essential to bringing the same prosperity of their times to his.  

"人生八歲，則自王公以下，至於庶人之子弟，皆入小學，而教之以灑掃、應對、進退之節，禮樂、射御、書數之文 ;" - When they turned eight years old, all the sons of the kings and dukes down to the common people, all entered elementary schools. They were taught the principles of mopping/cleaning, manners in conversation, and behaivour as well as the cultural arts of ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and numeracy."

. In these above mentioned dynasties, everybody was well educated from a young age in a variety of subjects, starting with basic practical skills such as cleaning and manners, leading to matters of ritual (禮  py. lǐ - a very important concept in confucianism that was unserstood as actions that could acutalise one's virtue (仁 - rén))   

"及其十有五年，則自天子之元子、眾子，以至公、卿、大夫、元士之適子，與凡民之俊秀，皆入大學，而教之以窮理、正心、修己、治人之道" - "When they reach the age of fifteen, from the imperial sons and the sons of the nobility, extending to the common people with talent and intelligence, all enter the Great Learning. They are then taught how to study exhaustively, correct their thoughts, cultivate themselves and govern others"

. This is the next stage of learning that men enter at the age of 15 where they further pursue their studies with greater intensity and depth, this time learning the end goals for the way, that is, self cultivation and the way to govern others based upon the confucian philosophy. It seems to be that this stage was available to less people than the first one seen as it is only for the talented. 

"此又學校之教、大小之節所以分也" - "this was the education divided into sections (based on ages as we've seen"

paragraph 3 
------------

"夫以學校之設，其廣如此，教之之術，其次第節目之詳又如此，而其所以為教，則又皆本之人君躬行心得之餘，不待求之民生日用彝倫之外，是以當世之人無不學" - "by means of the broad educational system, the art of teaching, its order and detailed arrangement - which is rooted in the ruler's personal practice and thorough understanding which exceeds that of the masses - ; not being beyond the lives and daily neccesities of people meaning there is no one who dosen't learn"

. In virtue of the education system and the rulers own practice, the way is not beyond the people and therefore everyone is able to learn of it.  

"其學焉者，無不有以知其性分之所固有，職分之所當為，而各俛焉以盡其力" - "of those who study, there is none who don't understand the distincitve characteristics of nature and The responsibilities they ought to fulfill ; Each bows down with diligence to exert their utmost effort

. 

"此古昔盛時所以治隆於上，俗美於下，而非後世之所能及也！" - "In ancient times during prosperous eras, the governance flourished above, and the conditions of the common people were beautiful below"

paragraph 4
-----------
"及周之衰，賢聖之君不作，學校之政不修，教化陵夷，風俗頹敗，時則有若孔子之聖，而不得君師之位以行其政教，於是獨取先王之法，誦而傳之以詔後世" - "During the decline of the Zhou dynasty, virtuous and sage rulers did not emerge. The governance of education and schools was neglected, and the teachings and culture were in decline. At such times, there were individuals resembling the wisdom of Confucius, yet they could not attain the position of rulers to implement their political and educational ideals At that time, they independently adopted the laws of the ancient kings, reciting and transmitting them as instructions for future generations."
