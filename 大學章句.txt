Synopsis
---------
It is a shame how little english literature there is presently on Confucianism, even more so Neo Confucianism; this great philsophical and spiritual tradition has been left relatively untouched by western scholarship and thus in this writting, the first of a series on Zhu xi's commentaries, I aim, even with my relatively limited knowledge on the topic (I am not at all a scholar), to shed some light on this neglected part of Chinese culture and Philsophy. Feel free to replicate the content in this text (and the site as whole) in whatever way you wish.    



Introduction
-------------
A short saying of Confucius -  
"學而時習之，不亦說乎？" [1] "to learn and in Time, apply it. Is that not a great pleasure ?"  

We don't have to go far, not far at all in fact, (the first line of the analects to be precise) to witness the significance Confucius places on learning  in the process of self cultivation and although this quote isn't from 大學 (the great learning, the focus of this part of Zhu Xi's collected commentaries on the four books - 四書章句集注) I felt it is very much necessary. For Confucius, learning is the start of becoming a 
君子 (Py. Junzi - meaning sage) and is what forms the basis for the rest of one's development; as we shall see next, Master Zhu explains the effect of learning from a metaphysical angle ( a key characteristic of Neo confucian thought) with concepts familiar in the philosophical/religious climate he was present in such as qi and Tian which helped to reinvigorate this learning  of Ru thought in China, and more widely east Asia.

Zhu Xi's Preface to the 大學
---------------------------------

Paragraph 1
---------------------
"古之大學所以教人之法也" - of old, the great learning of books has been the way of teaching people. 

The method of great learning has been employed in China since early times as a way of cultivation 

"蓋自天降生民 ，則既莫不與之以仁義禮智之性矣" - people descend from heaven and hence they are naturally endowed with the virtues of ren, li, justice and wisdom

These 4 virtues, known as 四端 also translated as four begginings or four seeds to reflect the proposed nature of them, that is that they are inherently inside every human is a premise emphasised particularly by Mengzi/mencius. As we can see, Zhu Xi takes this idea and expresses it in a metaphysical light - stating it was endowed by heaven.   

.however their chi is not necessarily the same, everyone doesn't posses the knowledge to fulfill their chi but with knowledge and wisdom they can actualisé it.

. heaven appoints such people with fulfilled qi and virtue to instruct / rule the masses, and will continue to choose the virtuous for this task 

. it is a matter of recovering and restoring qi 

Paragraph 2
---------------------

"三代之隆，其法寖備，然後王宮、國都以及閭巷，莫不有學" - "The three dynasties of flourishing  (Xia, Yin, Zhou) gradually perfected their ways in the districts they reigned over, no where was there not learning"

. I will certainly expand on this point when I write a commentary on the five classics but essentially, Confucius beleived that the study of historic dynasties (particularly the Zhou) and implementing their ways was essential to bringing the same prosperity of their times to his.  

"人生八歲，則自王公以下，至於庶人之子弟，皆入小學，而教之以灑掃、應對、進退之節，禮樂、射御、書數之文 ;" - When they turned eight years old, all the sons of the kings and dukes down to the common people, all entered elementary schools. They were taught the principles of mopping/cleaning, manners in conversation, and behaivour as well as the cultural arts of ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and numeracy."

. In these above mentioned dynasties, everybody was well educated from a young age in a variety of subjects, starting with basic practical skills such as cleaning and manners, leading to matters of ritual (禮  py. lǐ - a very important concept in confucianism that was unserstood as actions that could acutalise one's virtue (仁 - rén))   

"及其十有五年，則自天子之元子、眾子，以至公、卿、大夫、元士之適子，與凡民之俊秀，皆入大學，而教之以窮理、正心、修己、治人之道" - "When they reach the age of fifteen, from the imperial sons and the sons of the nobility, extending to the common people with talent and intelligence, all enter the Great Learning. They are then taught how to study exhaustively, correct their thoughts, cultivate themselves and govern others"

. This is the next stage of learning that men enter at the age of 15 where they further pursue their studies with greater intensity and depth, this time learning the end goals for the way, that is, self cultivation and the way to govern others based upon the confucian philosophy. It seems to be that this stage was available to less people than the first one seen as it is only for the talented. 

"此又學校之教、大小之節所以分也" - "this was the education divided into sections (based on ages as we've seen"

Paragraph 3 
------------

"夫以學校之設，其廣如此，教之之術，其次第節目之詳又如此，而其所以為教，則又皆本之人君躬行心得之餘，不待求之民生日用彝倫之外，是以當世之人無不學" - "by means of the broad educational system, the art of teaching, its order and detailed arrangement - which is rooted in the ruler's personal practice and thorough understanding which exceeds that of the masses - ; not being beyond the lives and daily neccesities of people meaning there is no one who dosen't learn"

. In virtue of the education system and the rulers own practice, the way is not beyond the people and therefore everyone is able to learn of it.  

"其學焉者，無不有以知其性分之所固有，職分之所當為，而各俛焉以盡其力" - "of those who study, there is none who don't understand the distincitve characteristics of nature and The responsibilities they ought to fulfill ; Each bows down with diligence to exert their utmost effort

. Zhu xi advocated for observing the characteristics of nature paired with 
nurturing one’s feeling of reverence in order to purify the mind and allign oneself with the original good nature that we all posses in order to act with correct conduct [3] 

"此古昔盛時所以治隆於上，俗美於下，而非後世之所能及也！" - "In ancient times during prosperous eras, the governance flourished above, and the conditions of the common people were beautiful below"

. I think it is necessary here to note the view that Confucius held on the ruler's influence on people ; for Confucius, the ruler had to simply display his own virtue outwardly and this in itslef would bring virtue and hence prosperity to his people below him ; Confucius gives an analogy of wind passing over grass, stating that just as the wind naturally bends the grass as it passes over it so does the virtue of the ruler naturally bend his people towards it [4]

Paragraph 4
-----------
"及周之衰，賢聖之君不作，學校之政不修，教化陵夷，風俗頹敗，時則有若孔子之聖，而不得君師之位以行其政教，於是獨取先王之法，誦而傳之以詔後世" - "During the decline of the Zhou dynasty, virtuous and sage rulers did not emerge. The governance of education and schools was neglected, and the teachings and culture were in decline. At such times, there were individuals resembling the wisdom of Confucius, yet they could not attain the position of rulers to implement their political and educational ideals At that time, they independently adopted the laws of the ancient kings, reciting and transmitting them as instructions for future generations."

. Having seen the great effect that confucianism has on the kingdom, we now see the inverse: in the abscence of virtuous rulers following the way and the general populace learning the way, the kingdom is sure to decline 

"若曲禮、少儀、內則、弟子職諸篇，固小學之支流餘裔，而此篇者，則因小學之成功，以著大學之明法，外有以極其規模之大，而內有以盡其節目之詳者也" - "If one examines the various writings on music, ritual, minor ceremonies, and the duties of students, these indeed represent the peripheral branches and descendants of the study of minor learning [taught to children of nobles]. However, this particular text, owing to the achievements of minor learning, serves to establish the clear principles of the great learning. Externally, it seeks to explore the grand scale of it, while internally, it aims to exhaustively elaborate on its detailed aspects."

. since this is all part of Zhu Xi's introduction to the great learning, he begins to explain what the text conatins, namely how it expands on the level learning that follows the first level of education taught to children.

"三千之徒，蓋莫不聞其說，而曾氏之傳獨得其宗，於是作為傳義，以發其意" - "The disciples numbering three thousand, indeed all have heard his teachings. However, it is only the transmission of the Zengzi that truly captures its essence. Therefore, a commentary is written to explain and elucidate its meaning"

. The great learning is attributed to confucius' immediate disciple Zengzi  

"及孟子沒而其傳泯焉，則其書雖存，而知者鮮矣！" - "When Mencius passed away and his teachings were lost, even though his writings exist, there are few who understand"

. Mencius was another early confucian writer who also wrote one of the four books, known simply as the Mencius (孟子 py. Mengzi). this sentence paired with the previous, stating 'there are few who understand' , and 'a commentary is written to explain and elucidate its meaning' display the profoundess of the way and how difficult it is to comprehend.    

Paragraph 5
------------
"自是以來，俗儒記誦詞章之習，其功倍於小學而無用；異端虛無寂滅之教，其高過於大學而無實" - "Since then, people have doubled their efforts in the common Confucian practice of memorizing phrases and sentences compared to elementary learning, yet it is useless; the heterodox teachings of emptiness and extinction surpass the heights of the Great Learning, yet lack substance"

. here Zhu Xi is explaining how people have gone beyond the method of great learning yet these methods are really quite useless.

"其他權謀術數，一切以就功名之說，與夫百家眾技之流，所以惑世誣民、充塞仁義者，又紛然雜出乎其閒" - "Other political stratergies and schemes all for the sake of achieving merit and fame, and the myriad skills of the hundred schools, therefore confusing the world, deceiving the people, and blocking up ren. Moreover, arising chaotically in their free time."

. building on the last point, Zhu Xi explains how these different pratices that differ from the original confucian teachings have lead to the confusing of the people and ultimately a loss of ren overall 

"使其君子不幸而不得聞大道之要，其小人不幸而不得蒙至治之澤，晦盲否塞，反覆沈痼，以及五季之衰，而壞亂極矣！" - "Causing sages to be unfortunate and unable to hear the essentials of the Great way, those of little capacities to be unfortunate and unable to receive the blessings of perfect rule, obscure and ignorant, obstructed and blocked, repeatedly sinking into affliction and illness, as well as the decline of the five seasons, resulting in extreme ruin and chaos"

- once again, emphasising previous points on the issue of trying other methods rather then than the orthodox one of great learning

Paragraph 6
-----------
"天運循環，無往不復。宋德隆盛，治教休明。於是河南程氏兩夫子出，而有以接乎孟氏之傳" - "The will of heaven goes and comes back around; there is nowhere it does not regain possession. During the flourishing era of the Song Dynasty, governance and education were splendid and clear. Then, the two masters of the Cheng family (known as the Cheng brothers) in Henan emerged, and there was a way to receive the transmission from mengzi"

The will of heaven / mandate of heaven (天命) was a reiligious and political idea that existed in China since ancient times, it was the theory that the soveriegn was appointed by heaven according to his conduct and the experience of the people under his rule ; if the ruler was virtuous, the opinion of heaven would be manifested in desirable natural circumstances such as good weather for good harvest ; if the ruler was unvirtuous however, undesirable phenomena would occur such as natural disatsers. This links in with Zhu Xi's statement here because he is saying that heaven has in the end restored righteous circumstances and rule to the song dynasty after the afore mentioned periods of catastrophe The cheng brothers were two philosopers that helped to pioneer what we know today as neo confucinism, their thought heavily influenced Zhu Xi. With the flourishing of the song dynasty and the presence of these new thinkers, the teachings from mengzi's writings could now be correctly understood (note earlier statement in the text when Zhu xi said that few undertsood what Zhu xi meant.

"實始尊信此篇而表章之，既又為之次其簡編，發其歸趣，然後古者大學教人之法、聖經賢傳之指，粲然復明於世" - "Truly, [the ancient] starts by respecting and believing in this passage, presenting it as a chapter. Having already arranged it, he again edits its simple compilation, expressing its intent. Afterwards, the ancients' method of teaching people in the Great Learning, along with the guidance and instructions of the Sacred Scriptures and Wise Transmission, brightly illuminates once again in the world."

. Zhu xi explains how the ancients have compiled the great learning into a small passage and how the method of teaching the way of great learning has shone brightly again in the world ie. come into prominence 

"雖以熹之不敏，亦幸私淑而與有聞焉" - "Although I am not wise, it is fortunate that I privately studied and thus possess knowledge

. Zhu Xi showing humility, believing that his own knowledge is lacking but at the same time, he was able to teach himself by studying.

"顧其為書猶頗放失，是以忘其固陋，采而輯之，閒亦竊附己意，補其闕略，以俟後之君子" - "Looking at the book [the great learning], there are still some areas that appear misinterpreted / neglected. Therefore, forgetting narrow-mindedness, I gather and organise it. Occasionally, I also secretly incorporate my own thoughts, supplementing and omitting [some thoughts / commentary], awaiting the arrival of later sages."

. Zhu Xi explains how he will intepret the text and build on the original in which it is typically interpreted, he will still away from the rigid traditional view on the book and instead, add his own thoughts to help supplement its meaning.

"極知僭踰，無所逃罪，然於國家化民成俗之意、學者修己治人之方，則未必無小補云" - "I am Extremely aware of overstepping boundaries, at which poimt there is no way to escape guilt. However, in the intention of transforming the nation and forming customs among the people, the method by which scholars cultivate themselves and govern others, the writing won't be without small supplements"

.Zhu Xi knows that there is a point at which interpretation has gone too far beyond the original meaning of the text but at the same time, he wishes for his thoughts to influence and transfom the customs of the people, the way scholars cultivate themselves and the state as a whole so his commentary won't be without at least some complements to the original text.

"淳熙己酉春二月申子，新安朱熹序" - "In the spring of the second month of the year Jiyou in the Shenzi reign, Zhu Xi's preface from Xinan" 

Jiyou was the 46th year of the sexegenary cycle used to record time in China. Shenzi refers to the chinese astrological sign of the monkey (9th sign of the 12 year system) and Xinan was the name of a Place west of present day Luoyang city, Henan province.

"於緝之於，音烏。詩文王之篇。穆穆，深遠之意。於，歎美辭。緝，繼續也。熙，光明也。敬止，言其無不敬而安所止也。引此而言聖人之止，無非至善。五者乃其目之大者也。學者於此，究其精微之蘊，而又推類以盡其餘，則於天下之事，皆有以知其所止而無疑矣"* - "In the pronunciation of '於', it resembles the sound of a crow. The chapters of King Wen's poetry and literature are solemn, expressing profound meanings. '於' denotes admiration for beautiful language, while '緝' signifies continuation. '熙' and '光明' represent brightness and radiance, while '敬止' refers to a respectful stop, where there is no disrespect and a sense of peace. Speaking of this, the sage's stop embodies nothing but the utmost goodness. These five aspects are the greatest focus. Scholars, by thoroughly studying their subtle essence and extending their understanding, can comprehend all affairs under heaven without doubt."

"詩云：「瞻彼淇澳，菉竹猗猗。有斐君子，如切如磋，如琢如磨。瑟兮僩兮，赫兮喧兮。有斐君子，終不可諠兮！」如切如磋者，道學也；如琢如磨者，自脩也；瑟兮僩兮者，恂慄也；赫兮喧兮者，威儀也；有斐君子，終不可諠兮者，道盛德至善，民之不能忘也" - "The poem speaks of the picturesque Qi Bay with lush reeds. An outstanding noble person is likened to continuous refinement, self-cultivation, caution, and dignified bearing. Despite these virtues, true nobility does not boast excessively. This is because the Dao is flourishing, virtue is complete, and the impact on the people is unforgettable"

"澳，於六反。菉，詩作綠。猗，協韻音阿。僩，下版反。喧，詩作咺，諠，詩作諼；並況晚反。恂，鄭氏讀作峻。詩衛風淇澳之篇。淇，水名。澳，隈也。猗猗，美盛貌。興也。斐，文貌。切以刀鋸，琢以椎鑿，皆裁物使成形質也。磋以鑢鐋1，磨以沙石，皆治物使其滑澤也。治骨角者，既切而復磋之。治玉石者，既琢而復磨之。皆言其治之有緒，而益致其精也。瑟，嚴密之貌。僩，武毅之貌。赫喧，宣著盛大之貌。諠，忘也。道，言也。學，謂講習討論之事，自脩者，省察克治之功。恂慄，戰懼也。威，可畏也。儀，可象也。引詩而釋之，以明明明德者之止於至善。道學自脩，言其所以得之之由。恂慄、威儀，言其德容表裏之盛。卒乃指其實而歎美之也"* - "At the sixth turn, 'Lù' in poetry is written as 'green,' and 'Yī' coordinates with the rhyme sound 'ā.' 'Xiàn' is a variant form indicating obstruction downward. 'Xuān' in poetry can be written as 'xuān' or 'xuān,' and consider the reverse for 'wǎn.' 'Xún,' when read by the Zheng family, is pronounced as 'jùn.' The poem 'Qí Ào' in the Wèifēng category of the Book of Songs describes the river 'Qí' and a secluded corner 'ào,' both symbolizing a gracefully flourishing and beautiful appearance, signifying flourishing and elegance in literary appearance. It also describes the meticulous processes of cutting, carving, polishing with files and tools, and grinding with sand and stones, all aimed at shaping and treating things to achieve smoothness and gloss. Similarly, in treating bones and horns, after cutting, they are polished again. One who works on jade and stones, after carving, polishes them again. All acknowledge that this work has a method, leading to an enhancement of its essence. The appearances of dignified meticulousness, martial vigor, grandeur, and forgetfulness are described. 'Dao' is equated with speech, and 'learning' refers to the activities of discussion and learning. For those who cultivate themselves, it means examining and mastering the practice of virtue. 'Trembling in fear,' 'awe-inspiring,' and 'worthy of emulation' describe the demeanor. Quoting poetry to clarify that those with clear virtues adhere to the highest goodness. Cultivating oneself in the Dao and learning, speaking of the ways through which one attains it. 'Trembling and awe-inspiring demeanor' speaks of the abundance of virtue both internally and externally. Finally, pointing to its reality and praising its beauty" 

"詩云：「於戲前王不忘！」君子賢其賢而親其親，小人樂其樂而利其利，此以沒世不忘也" - "The poetry emphasizes that even before engaging in recreational activities, a wise ruler does not forget his responsibilities. A noble person values the virtuous and is close to family, while a petty person prioritizes personal pleasure and self-interest. These principles endure throughout generations and are not forgotten"

"於戲，音嗚呼。樂，音洛。詩周頌烈文之篇。於戲，歎辭。前王，謂文、武也。君子，謂其後賢後王。小人，謂後民也。此言前王所以新民者止於至善，能使天下後世無一物不得其所，所以既沒世而人思慕之，愈久而不忘也。此兩節詠歎淫泆，其味深長，當熟玩之"* - "In the realm of entertainment, the sound is joyous. Music, with the sound of luò, is akin to the splendid literary pieces in the poetry of the Zhou Songs. In the context of play, there is an expression of deep emotions and lamentations. The term 'former kings' refers to those who embodied both civil and military virtues. 'Gentlemen' refers to virtuous individuals and future kings, while 'small people' denotes the commoners in later generations. This passage conveys that the former kings, through their pursuit of ultimate goodness, ensured that everything in the world of later generations found its proper place. As a result, even after their passing, people continue to think about and admire them, and this admiration deepens over time. These two lines express admiration and deep emotions about the profound and lasting impact of the former kings' virtuous influence, encouraging readers to carefully appreciate and savor the sentiments conveyed."

"子曰：「聽訟，吾猶人也，必也使無訟乎！」無情者不得盡其辭。大畏民志，此謂知本" - "Listening to lawsuits, I am still just a human; certainly, I must make it so that there are no lawsuits! Those without feeling cannot fully present their arguments. Great is the fear of the will of the people; this is called knowing the root" 

"猶人，不異於人也。情，實也。引夫子之言，而言聖人能使無實之人不敢盡其虛誕之辭。蓋我之明德既明，自然有以畏服民之心志，故訟不待聽而自無也。觀於此言，可以知本末之先後矣"* - "Similar to humans, not different from them. Feelings are indeed real. Quoting the words of Confucius, it is said that the sage has the ability to make those without genuine substance refrain from fully expressing their empty and deceptive words. Indeed, my clear moral integrity naturally has the means to awe and gain the submission of the hearts and minds of the people. Therefore, disputes need not be heard; they naturally cease to exist. Considering this statement, one can understand the prioritization of the fundamental and the incidental."
